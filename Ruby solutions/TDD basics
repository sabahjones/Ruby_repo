Rspec methods:

1. Describe - wraps test environment - Similiar in scope to a Function

2. Context - also similar to function but sections out different areas of code. Like a Method.

3. It - used as a header to "describe" specific tests. Scope is simlar to an IF statement.

4. Expect - states the expected result. Like a condition in regular code.

5. Before - runs before the code (inside Describe). Like assigning variables before the function/method runs.


Running a test:
  - write up the test code (an example below). place the code and test code in the same folder.
    - "project_spec.rb" = test file
    - "project.rb" = code file        ## not sure if this can be changed.

Example:

RSpec.describe "Buy a soda" do
    before(:each) do
        @buyer = Buyer.new
    end

    context "has money" do
        before(:each) do
            @buyer.money = 10
        end
        it "can buy a soda" do
            expect(@buyer.buy_soda).to eq(true)
        end
    end
    context "doesn't have money" do
        before(:each) do
            @buyer.money = 0
        end
        it "can't buy a soda" do
            expect(@buyer.buy_soda).to eq(false)
        end
    end
end
